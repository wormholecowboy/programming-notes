MISC
- Layers: allow you to create dependencies b/w the functions
- Lambda charges for duration of runtime for FNs
    - if calling other lambdas, you may want to use async, otherwise first lambda will wait for response and double bill you

FUNCTIONS 
- Runtime settings must have correct filename:functionname (ex. lambda_function:lambda_handler)
    -handler is the app entry point
    -handler(event, context)  // context tells you about runtime env.
- Async does not tell client about failure, need Dead Letter Queue for that

DURATION & TIMEOUTS
- longer timeouts aren't always better
- async gets terminated if timeout is reached
- default timeout is 3s



MEMORY
- be careful: incr memory incr other resources as well (EC2 instance)
    - but can reduce the impact of cold start (node and python have best perf here)
    - not linear incr
