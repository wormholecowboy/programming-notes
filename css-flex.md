ðŸ’¡ MISC

</aside>

- better for small layouts and components (use GRID for big layouts)
- main axis = horizontal
- cross axis = vertical

```css
.container{
	display: flex /* or inline-flex 
	
		main axis â€“ The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).
    main-start | main-end â€“ The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
    main size â€“ A flex itemâ€™s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the itemâ€™s main size. The flex itemâ€™s main size property is either the â€˜widthâ€™ or â€˜heightâ€™ property, whichever is in the main dimension.
    cross axis â€“ The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
    cross-start | cross-end â€“ Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
    cross size â€“ The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the itemâ€™s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of â€˜widthâ€™ or â€˜heightâ€™ that is in the cross dimension.

	 PARENT PROPERTIES */
		flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse 
			/* establishes main axis*/
		flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
		flex-flow: column wrap; /* shorthand

		NOTE: reverse will also reverse things in justify-content!!!
		NOTE: changing to a column reverses justify-content and align-items!!! */
		
		justify-content: ; /* defines alighment along main 
			flex-start
			flex-end
			center
			space-evenly
			space-around
			space-between */

		align-items: ; /* defines alignment along cross
			flex-start
			flex-end
			center
			baseline
			stretch */

		align-content: ; /* aligns items along cross in multi-line, wrapped scenarios
			flex-start
			flex-end
			center
			space-around
			space-between */

		gap: ; row-gap: ; column-gap: ; /* greats gutters inside, NOT outside! */
		
		/* CHILD PROPERTIES */

.item {

		order: ; /* use pos and neg numbers to shift items back and forth */
		flex-grow: 1; /* grows items relative to each other ex. 2 is 2x the size of others */
		flex-shrink: 1; 
		flex-basis: 100; /* basically works like min-width as you scale down, pixels or ems */
		flex: grow, shrink, basis; /*shorthand*/
		align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
			/* overrides default alignment */

run your CSS through Autoprefixer, which handles the fallbacks very well.
